# Pruning-Neural-Networks

### This project explores the extent to which a neural network can be pruned. 

Neural networks can be very large and storing the unnecessary weights and units of a neural network increases the size and makes it less easier for use on devices with limited resources. Pruning is one of the solutions that addresses this problem.
The process of pruning goes from analyzing how many connections/units are redundant in calculating the output of a neural network and then implementing efficient strategy for removing them.
